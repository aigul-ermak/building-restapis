# REST APIs Practice

A comprehensive project focused on designing and implementing REST APIs with modern best practices, featuring Entity Framework Core integration and advanced API functionalities.

## Overview

This project demonstrates practical implementation of RESTful web services, covering essential concepts from basic CRUD operations to advanced features like filtering, sorting, and pagination. Built with a focus on clean architecture and industry standards.

## Features

### Core API Design
- **RESTful Architecture**: Following REST principles and conventions
- **HTTP Methods**: Complete implementation of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations
- **Resource-based URLs**: Clean and intuitive endpoint design
- **Status Codes**: Proper HTTP status code usage

### Database Integration
- **Entity Framework Core**: Modern ORM for data access
- **Code-First Approach**: Database schema generation from models
- **Migrations**: Version control for database changes
- **Relationships**: Support for complex entity relationships

### CRUD Operations
- **GET**: Retrieve single resources and collections
- **POST**: Create new resources with validation
- **PUT**: Update existing resources completely
- **DELETE**: Remove resources with proper cleanup

### Advanced Features
